YSD_FIELDSET_RENDERS
====================

<p>The render process of all the components is delegated into renders to isolate the model from the view.</p>

<p>An fieldset is a set of fields which are tied to represent a concept. The model are defined in the <strong>ysd_md_fieldset</strong> gem, but the rendering of them are done here.</p>

<p>The available fieldset are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact: Email, phone numbers, website, ...</li>
  <li>Location: Address</li>
  <li>Photo: A photo and their thumbnails urls</li>
  <li>Event: Start and finish date and time</li>
</ul>

<p>More can be created and their representation can be added to this project</p>

<p>To create a render you can create up to 3 files in the views folder</p>
